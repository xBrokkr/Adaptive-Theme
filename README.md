# Adaptive Theme 🌗

**Adaptive Theme** is a smart browser extension designed to improve focus and readability by intelligently adapting website themes. Unlike simple color inverters, it analyzes the page content to preserve brand aesthetics while ensuring a comfortable viewing experience.

## Features

- **Smart Dark Mode**: Automatically turns bright websites into a dark theme without breaking the design.
- **Smart Light Mode**: Inverts natively dark websites to light mode for better readability in bright environments.
- **Intelligent Color Preservation**: Detects brand colors (like buttons, logos) and preserves their hue while adjusting luminance, so a red button stays red.
- **Image & Video Protection**: Automatically excludes media content from inversion to prevent "negative photo" effects.
- **Re-process Capability**: Includes a "Re-process Page" button to handle dynamic content or correct visual glitches on the fly.

## Usage

1. Click the extension icon in your browser toolbar.
2. Use the toggle switch to Enable/Disable the extension.
3. Select your preferred mode:
   - **Dark Mode**: Best for low-light environments.
   - **Light Mode**: Best for bright environments or reading text-heavy dark sites.
4. If a page looks incorrect, click **"Re-process Page"** to force a refresh of the theme logic.
